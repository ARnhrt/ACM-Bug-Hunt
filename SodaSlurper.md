[Picture of Soda](Soda)

Tim is an absolutely obsessive soda drinker; he cannot get enough. 
Most annoyingly, though, he rarely has any money, so his only obvious legal 
way to obtain more soda is to take the money he gets when he recycles empty 
soda bottles to buy new ones. In addition to the empty bottles resulting from 
his own consumption, he sometimes finds empty bottles in the street. 
One day, he was extra thirsty, so he actually drank sodas until he couldn’t afford a new one.

**INPUT**<br>
Three non-negative integers (e, f, c) where e 
equals the number of empty soda bottles in Tim’s possession at the start of the day, 
f equals the number of empty soda bottles found during the day, and 
c equals the number of empty bottles required to buy a new soda.

**OUTPUT**<br>
